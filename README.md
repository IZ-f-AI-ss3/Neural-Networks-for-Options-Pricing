# Neural-Networks-for-Options-Pricing
Implementation of a research paper on using neural networks for options pricing. This repository applies deep learning techniques to model and predict financial option prices, following the methodology outlined in the paper. Ideal for those interested in the intersection of mathematics ($\phi$) and ML . 

This project was undertaken for a leading French bank to explore the use of neural networks in options pricing, with a comparison to traditional pricing methods.

The second part of the project focuses on a personal optimization of the initial work. It features a refined, clean, and easy-to-read codebase, providing significant improvements over the original implementation (C_projet.ipynb), with a difference between upper and lower bound equal to the one provided by the article .


## For 1 November :
The last aspect, which is another personal contribution, involves the use of 'spno' (I'll explain it in detail later, and I may write a technical paper about it if I find the time). It focuses on improving the convergence of this model by reducing the number of parameters and requiring fewer epochs per training step.
