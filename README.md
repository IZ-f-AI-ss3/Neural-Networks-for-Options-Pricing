# Neural-Networks-for-Options-Pricing
Implementation of a research paper on using neural networks for options pricing. This repository applies deep learning techniques to model and predict financial option prices, following the methodology outlined in the paper. Ideal for those interested in the intersection of mathematics ($\phi$) and ML . 

This project was conducted for a major French bank to evaluate the potential of using neural networks for options pricing, comparing this method with classical pricing techniques.
